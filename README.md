# mock-app
This project I made to test my skills for the ReactJs and I have created a Nav bar on the nav bar there are 3 navlinks for home page, students list and add new students.
If you find something new to add please approach me on the given email below.

So, the app is named as mock app as you have seen it.

To run this project locally, you need to download this files to your system
Then the download zip and unzip it 
First of all, you need to open this folder in any IDE, I prefer VS code
to run this project u need to create a react app and node.js must be install to your computer and few packages like react-router-dom

 to create new react app:
 make a separate folder
 open command prompt through that folder on writing cmd in the address bar
 then,
 
  commands:
  
  npx create-react-app filename
  
  npm i react-router-dom --verbose(for react router dom package) 
  

Follow this command to run :
 
 npm start
 
 then you will see the project will run to your browser. It will take some time to load the project successfully.
 
Now the project is running successfully.

Thank you.
